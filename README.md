## 1. 📖 What Are Functions in JavaScript?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can take inputs (parameters), perform operations, and return outputs. In JavaScript, functions are **first-class citizens** — they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

---

## 2. 🔍 Types of Functions

JavaScript offers multiple ways to define functions:

- **Function declarations** – Traditional, named functions.
- **Function expressions** – Functions stored in variables.
- **Arrow functions** – Introduced in ES6, with shorter syntax and lexical `this`.
- **Constructor functions** – Used with `new` keyword to create object instances.

---

## 3. ⚡ Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions. They:

- Do **not** bind their own `this`
- Are often used for **callbacks** and **array operations**
- Cannot be used as constructors
- Cannot access `arguments` object (use rest `...args` instead)

## 4. 🔁 Differences Between Regular and Arrow Functions

| Feature            | Regular Function       | Arrow Function            |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Syntax             | Verbose                | Concise                   |
| `this` binding     | Dynamic (based on call) | Lexical (inherited)      |
| `arguments` object | Available              | Not available             |
| Constructors       | Can be used            | Cannot be used            |

## 5. 🧮 Function Parameters and Rest Syntax

JavaScript supports:

- **Fixed parameters**
- **Rest parameters (`...args`)** for collecting an indefinite number of arguments
- **Spread syntax** to pass arguments from an array

These improve function flexibility and readability.

---

## 6. 🧩 Default Parameters

Default parameters allow you to set default values if no argument is provided:

- Help avoid undefined values
- Useful for optional configurations and fallbacks

---

## 7. 🔓 Destructuring Objects in Function Parameters

You can directly extract values from an object **inside the function parameter list** using destructuring. 
This improves clarity when functions expect structured input and avoids repetitive dot notation.

It's especially powerful when dealing with:

- Configuration objects
- API responses
- Nested properties

Nested destructuring is also supported to extract deep values inline.
